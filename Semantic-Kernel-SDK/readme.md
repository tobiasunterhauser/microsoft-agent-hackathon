# Hands-On Hack Session 2: Semantic Kernel

In this exercise, you use Semantic Kernel SDK with Azure AI Foundry Agents and the Handoff Orchestration Pattern from Semantic Kernel


> **Note**: Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.


## What are we building ? 🚀


In this exercise we **Multi-Agent Support System** for Munich Agent Factory GmbH. This system will automate and support for and customer service requests regarding purchased orders by orchestrating multiple specialized agents.

### Your Implementation Requirements

- **Agent Orchestration:** The system must coordinate several specialized agents (e.g., for order status, refunds, and returns).
- **Intent Routing:** User requests must be automatically routed to the correct agent based on intent.
- **Domain Coverage:** The system should support order management and general customer support scenarios.
- **Conversational Interface:** Provide a seamless, user-friendly conversational interface for employees and support staff (e.g., via Gradio).
- **Plugin Integration:** Each agent should be able to call domain-specific plugins (e.g., for checking order status, processing refunds, handling returns).


You drew a first draft on how to solve the problem using the **Handoff Orchestration Pattern** provided by the **Semantic Kernenl SDK**

### Let's start hacking!

## Setup the local environment

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using your IDE VSC Integration idealy VS Code ;) or directly via the command line:
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/tobiasunterhauser/ai-foundry-agents-workshop
    ```

1. (If not yet done in the previous exercise) Login into your azure subscription that was used to create your 
   Foundry 
   Project:
    ```
   az login
    ```

1. (Optional) If the previous command doesn't work this means that the azure cli is not yet installed on your local
   machine. Install it following the official Documentation and repeat the previous step: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest

1. Open a terminal in the project root and go into the right directory for this session

   ```
    cd Hands-On-Hacking-Session-2 
    ```

1. Setup a virtual python environment:

    ```
    (Windows)
   python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

    (Mac)
    python3 -m venv labenv
    source labenv/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install necassary packages int othe virtual environment:

    ```
    pip install python-dotenv azure-identity semantic-kernel[azure] 

    ````

1. Open the **.env** file and  replace the **your_project_endpoint** placeholder with the endpoint for your project (copied from the project **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal), and the **your_model_deployment** placeholder with the name you assigned to your gpt-4o model deployment.

1. After you've replaced the placeholders, use the **CTRL+S** command to save your changes and then use the **CTRL+Q** command to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

**You are now ready to go!**
 

## Start Coding 🧑‍💻

Now you're ready to create the agents for your multi-agent solution! Let's get started!

1. Open the **code.py** file

1. Find the comment **Add references** and add the following code to import the classes you'll need:

    ```python
    from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
    from semantic_kernel.agents import Agent, HandoffOrchestration, OrchestrationHandoffs, AzureAIAgent, AzureAIAgentSettings
    from semantic_kernel.agents.runtime import InProcessRuntime
    from semantic_kernel.contents import (
        AuthorRole,
        ChatMessageContent,
        FunctionCallContent,
        FunctionResultContent,
        StreamingChatMessageContent,
    )
    from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function
    ```
Note how this time we are referencing **only the semantic_kernel SDK** and not the Foundry SDK

1. Locate the comment **Create the support agent in Azure AI Foundry** and add the following code: 

    ```python
    support_agent_definition = await project_client.agents.create_agent(
        model=ai_agent_settings.model_deployment_name,
        name="SupportAgent",
        instructions="Handle customer support requests and triage them to the appropriate agents.",
        description="A customer support agent that triages issues."
    )
    ```
This creates the Agent with the defined properties in AI Foundry

    
1. Locate the comment right underneath **Create the created support agent as an AzureAIAgent instance** and add the following code
    
    ```python
    support_agent = AzureAIAgent(
        client=project_client,
        definition=support_agent_definition
    )
    ```
This instantiates an AzureAIAgent instance of the created Foundry Agent. This allows to invoke the agent in Semantic Kernel Orchestration Patterns and call kernel function plugins. [See Full Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/semantic-kernel/semantic_kernel.agents.azureaiagent?view=semantic-kernel-python)

1. Locate the comment **Define the plugin for handling order-related tasks** and add the following code. 
    ```python
    class OrderStatusPlugin:
    @kernel_function
    def check_order_status(self, order_id: str) -> str:
        """Check the status of an order."""
        # Simulate checking the order status
        return f"Order {order_id} is shipped and will arrive in 2-3 days."
    ```

1. Locate the comment **Create the Order Status agent** and create the Agent that calls the OrderStatus Plugin:
    
    ```python
    order_status_agent_definition = await project_client.agents.create_agent(
        model=ai_agent_settings.model_deployment_name,
        name="OrderStatusAgent",
        description="A customer support agent that checks order status.",
        instructions="Handle order status requests."
    )
    order_status_agent = AzureAIAgent(
        client=project_client,
        definition=order_status_agent_definition,
        plugins=[OrderStatusPlugin()]
    )
    ```
1. Locate the comment **Define the plugin for handling refunds**. Observe how the **OrderStatusPlugin** was created. And create a similar Plugin named **OrderRefundPlugin**  that checks if a specific order id is eligible for refund. Be creative. The return statement should look something like this:

    ```python
        return f"Refund for order {order_id} has been processed successfully."
    ```

1. Locate the comment **Create the Refund agent**. Observe how the order_status Agent was created and Create the **refund_agent**. Don't forget to call your **OrderRefundPlugin**. User the following parameter:
    
    ```python
    name="RefundAgent",
    description="A customer support agent that handles refunds.",
    instructions="Handle refund requests."
    ```
1. Locate the comment **Define plugin for handling order returns** and create the **OrderReturnPlugin**

1. Locate the comment **Create the Order Return agent**. And create the **order_return_agent**  using the following parameter:

    ```python
    name="OrderReturnAgent",
    description="A customer support agent that handles order returns.",
    instructions="Handle order return requests."
    ```

1. Locateh the logic for the Agent handoffs at the comment **Define the handoff relationships between agents**  and add the following code: 

    ```python
    handoffs = (
        OrchestrationHandoffs()
        .add_many(
            source_agent=support_agent.name,
            target_agents={
                refund_agent.name: "Transfer to this agent if the issue is refund related",
                order_status_agent.name: "Transfer to this agent if the issue is order status related",
                order_return_agent.name: "Transfer to this agent if the issue is order return related",
            },
        )
        .add(
            source_agent=refund_agent.name,
            target_agent=support_agent.name,
            description="Transfer to this agent if the issue is not refund related",
        )
        .add(
            source_agent=order_status_agent.name,
            target_agent=support_agent.name,
            description="Transfer to this agent if the issue is not order status related",
        )
        .add(
            source_agent=order_return_agent.name,
            target_agent=support_agent.name,
            description="Transfer to this agent if the issue is not order return related",
        )
    )
    ```

1. Locate the comment **Create the handoff orchestration with the agents and handoffs** and add the following code:

    ```python
    handoff_orchestration = HandoffOrchestration(
        members=agents,
        handoffs=handoffs,
        streaming_agent_response_callback=streaming_agent_response_callback,
        human_response_function=human_response_function,
    )
    ```

1. Use the **CTRL+S** command to save your changes to the code file.

1. Run the code by entering the following command in the terminal: 
    
    ```
   python code.py
    ```

    **Congrats! You can now interact with the Agent Orchestration in the terminal**


1. Check in the AI Foundry Portal the 4 Agents that have been created.
